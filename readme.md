# Clear The Keep!
### Fantasy Roguelike 
> Final Project for COSC 302 at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
### Developed by **Roan Morgan**, **Jonathan Attanasio**, **Ryan Grychowski**, and **Yves Song**

###  Development TODO List:
1. Add combat mechanics
> Damage from contact with enemy
> Damage from being hit by a weapon
2. Weapon Drops
> Add more weapons in order to add variation
> Add an object that acts as a dropped item that can be picked up
> Add a weapon switching system that changes the player's current weapon and put the old one on the floor
3. More comprehensive world design
> Add hallways to connect rooms
> Add more room variation
> Add traps and other hazards
4. Add door mechanics (open/close)
> Based off how many enemies are present in a room
> Possibly key functionality (but doubtful for now)
5. Final Boss
> Make a cool final boss room
> Find final boss music that goes well with the genre and theme
> Find / (Girlfriend might be able to animate) Final Boss (Possibly a dragon or something of the like)6
6. Final Credits
7. UI stuff
> Start Screen
> Pause Screen
> Health bar
> Coins?
> Weapon cooldown timer
