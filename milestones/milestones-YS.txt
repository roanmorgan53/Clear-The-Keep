Description:
Researching GoDot framework and we can leverage it for project/game use

Report:
So far, I’ve taken advantage of learning something new with the GoDot framework. 
It’s been interesting researching and discussing with my groupmates about the ideas that we’ll be using and the roles each of us have. 
Moving forward, I will integrate dedicated time towards the coding aspect, but for now I’ve been researching the principles of GoDot.
